This is an package for fitting additive risk model with potentially heterogeneous subgroup survival rates as auxiliary information.
The underlying methods are based on the paper titled "*Fitting additive risk models using auxiliary information*", which has been accepted by *Statistics in Medicine* with DOI: 10.1002/sim.9649. 

The main function is **AR.AuxSP.AGMM()**. 
The key techniques we used are generalized method of moments and penalization.
